# Todo
* Highlight the winning grid items (line)
* Add Game Menu
* Save scores from previous sessions
* Add Human vs Computer gameplay
* If more features are added to the gameplay in the future, if might be worth having separate .swift files for Model and Controller classes
* Use Visual Format Language & NSLayoutConstraint instead of storyboard for main game view
* Write Unit tests

# Note
In this implementation, I used callbacks over delegation. I believe for a simple game application like this using callbacks in Swift (instead of delegates) reduce unnecessary code and provide decoupled, easy to test, and clear code.
